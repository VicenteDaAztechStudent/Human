# Human
1st Modular Programming Example Commit 

Created a short Java program via Spring Tool Suit 4, where we take a quick look at Modular Programming.
We seperate logic into the Human.java class, the blueprint on creating instances of Human type objects.
In Earth.java class, we re-use the logic in Human.java class to create our different Humans (Jose, Ramon, Tom)
, this is very important in OOP. We need to break down the logic into smaller portions, so through out the app we can
re-use the logic in a concise way. We don't want to write long logic everytime we create a Human type object.
Why code, when we can code(). Enjoy!
